# Module 21

## Intro
The purpose of this activity was to create a fungible token that will allow people from Earth to convert their money to KaseiCoin, the Mars cryptocurrency. This will be very helpful for people running away from Earth. The token is ERC-20 compliant (of course) and it will be minted using a Crowdsale contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library. This is all done by working on both of the project files provided in Remix IDE (https://remix.ethereum.org). I had a difficult time saving my compiled files in Remix IDE, so I copy and pasted the code that I wrote into individual GitHub files and labeled them as if they were the original sol files.
